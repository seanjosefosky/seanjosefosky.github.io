## Making changes

   A more structured and fulfilling life is something I’ve been pursuing for several years now. Planning out days, weeks, months, and working towards goals are things that people ***know*** are important when trying to have a structured and fulfilled life. Unfortunately, I did not know ***why*** those things were important. It made a surface-level logical sense to have tasks planned out and complete them in timely matters, but meanwhile the lack of future oriented thinking is what kept me from reaching the potential I had.

   I won’t lie and say that I am where I want to be. I am not even close to where I want to be when it comes to consistently applying structure and discipline in my life. But I have a ***taste*** of the benefits that come with the lifestyle I am striving for. To show examples of what I mean, I will list out the successes I’ve had with these philosophies, and the (probably many more) things that I still struggle with, respectfully:

**Successes**

- Mental Health
    - Therapy, with few breaks since 2021, has helped me learn about the expansive list of different emotions, how to understand what emotion(s) I (or another person) feel in a particular moment, and how to address said emotion(s) healthily (emotional maturity). Therapy also helped me confront and overcome addictions that I was too afraid to address.
    - Psychiatry got me medicine that helps me live without a *burdening* level of depression. I still feel it there waiting for me to slip and am afraid I always will, but alas.
        
        > *“…there's always a low hum of sadness, a low rumbling of ennui. So [our album] is the understanding that I'm always going to have it, it's always going to be there, it's always been there for literal generations of my family and it's important that I accept that and live and work through it.” - Dan ‘Soupy’ Campbell, The Wonder Years (band)*
        > 
- Physical Health
    - Exercise is a wonderful way to relieve stress and help me feel confident in how I carry myself.
    - A nutritional diet has helped me not only attribute to better exercise outcomes, but also helps me feel more mindful, less stressed, and save money. (This also includes staying well hydrated)
    - Sleep is probably the most important thing to do well and consistently out of everything else here. When I sleep well I’m in a better mood and am more likely to abide by my other routines and disciplines.
- Education
    - I’ve recently decided that it’s my social, and maybe even civic, duty to never stop educating myself. My opinion is that it is irresponsible as an adult, a role model, a parent, an *American*, a human, to be complacent.
    - Going back to college and pushing my limits has helped me see what potential I have. Never before did I study for school and really know what I could be good at, unless I was just good at it to begin with.
    - Outside of college, I study philosophy, programming, self-help topics, and other things that help me in improving emotional maturity, relationship building, career, and potential future career building.
- Habits
    - I try and follow daily, weekly, and monthly habits. These help lessen surprises in my life and keep me from experiencing unexpected stress.
        - Daily: hygiene routine before and after I sleep, feed animals, vacuum house, etc.
        - Weekly: cut the dogs nails, clean the bathroom, take stock of things in house, etc.
        - Monthly: check budget, schedule appointments, etc.
    - Preceding sections also apply here. For example:
        - Run at least 3 days every week.
        - Therapy twice a month
        - etc.
- Hobbies
    - It’s important for me to have a variety of hobbies because I get burnt out on things and need something else to pivot to.

**Struggles: *things that I don’t consistently do, or haven’t yet tackled***

- Mental health
    - Sometimes I forget to take my medicine for a few days, or I am too lazy to drive to the pharmacy, and I FEEL it. Things start falling apart and take a while to build it back up again. This is something that I have built into my morning routine and has been working better.
    - Even though therapy/counseling is great to have as an unbiased source to vent, I often lose track of how things have been since my last session and waste time trying to think of something to talk about or work on.
- Physical health
    - I really just started running this year and have not been too consistent with it. I feel guilty when I don’t reach my weekly goal and besides that, I just don’t feel as physically and mentally good when I don’t exercise.
    - I just recently started taking sleep seriously and have felt the great affects of doing it right, and doing it wrong. If I don’t give myself enough time before bed to wind down, or eat something too close to bed time, or drink alcohol or caffeine, I will not sleep well and will have a rough next day. This is especially hard when I’m working on something before bed or am playing a game—I sometimes don’t have the discipline to stop what I’m doing for the wellness of my future self. For example, I got drunk 4 nights ago and did not sleep well that night. The following night I stayed up playing a game past when I should have, and did not sleep well. It’s like I have to rebuild all of my habits again at a disadvantage.
- Education
    - I’m still learning what it takes to do well in school and I haven’t done well in all of my classes since I started college again in 2023. It makes me question if I’m pursuing the right thing sometimes. School is always on my mind and it just exponentially compounds as stress if I don’t feel sufficiently studied. I want to push aside my wants and focus on what is needed to do well in school.
    - My goal this year was to read one book per month and so far I think I have completed two or three and have started like six others. It’s not a bad thing, per se, but I feel like I took on too many books at the same time. It kind of feels wrong when I leave a book unfinished to start another. I want to actually complete books because it is important to me.
- Habits
    - These things are the foundation, other than sleep, for me to feeling accomplished and on top of things. I don’t always check off everything on the to-do list, I don’t always wash my face and brush my teeth before bed, and I definitely don’t always do chores when I should. A lot of the time, it’s small tasks compounding into large stressors that take up space in my mind.
- Hobbies
    - I have a love-hate relationship with hobbies because I often do them with some sort of underlying gainful purpose. For example:
        - I often make music with the idea that *other* people will like it, and not for myself just to enjoy the creative process
        - I will shame myself for playing another video game without completing another first. Kind of the same thing with books, I won’t finish one and will start another.
        - Although part of it is for business potential now, programming started for me as a hobby, but I always felt compelled to practice it and learn more as if I was reliant on it.
- Other
    - I am horrible at setting boundaries with other people, but more importantly with myself.
        - Sometimes I will allow myself to do things that will interrupt the flow of what I am wanting to achieve, and will thus set me back in progression. i.e.: not winding down before bed thus making the following day bad.
        - Mostly with my family, I have allowed myself to take on a lot of emotional baggage. I have unclear expectations of others and unclear boundaries when it comes to people in my family. It has been extremely stressful for me to be the peacekeeper in my family and allowing myself to feel responsible for other people’s wellbeing.

   Initially this was just a journal entry, but I just got done listening to a podcast that was focused on life planning and I guess I had a lot to say. After I’m done writing this, I will be putting together a document, or many, that will go over my values, plans, goals, ideas, etc. I want to be a positive influence on people in my life now, and people that will be in my life in the future. I know that everything I want to achieve won’t happen immediately, because I will burn out. So now, I will make a list of goals:
